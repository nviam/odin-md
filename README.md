# odin-md

A lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use Markdown-to-HTML conversion library 
written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/). It provides a minimal set of
features to parse and render Markdown documents into clean HTML, making it 
suitable for blogs, static site generators, and documentation tools.

## Features

- Converts standard Markdown syntax to HTML
- Support for:
  - Headings (`#`, `##`, etc.)
  - Paragraphs and line breaks
  - Bold (`**text**`) and italic (`*text*`)
  - Inline code (`` `code` ``)
  - Code blocks (fenced with triple backticks)
  - Links (`[text](url)`)
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)

> This is a work-in-progress library. Advanced features like tables, 
footnotes, or extensions are not yet supported.
